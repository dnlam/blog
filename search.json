Relying on the pretrained language model, we are going to fine-tune it to classify the reviews, and it works as sentiment analysis.\nBased on a language model which has been trained to guess what the next word in the text is, we will apply transfer learning method for this NLP task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Transfer learning workflow for movie classifier\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, we will start with the Wikipedia language model with a subset which we called Wikitext103. Then, we are going to create an IMDb language model which predicts the next word of a movie reviews. This intermediate learning will help us to learn about IMDb-specific kinds of words like the name of actors and directors. Afterward, we end up with our classifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-Step Transfer Learning Process\n\n\n\n\nPre-trained Model: Start with Wikitext103 language model\nDomain Adaptation: Fine-tune on IMDb movie reviews\n\nTask-Specific: Create sentiment classifier"

    "text": "Tokenization\nBasically, tokenization convert the text into list of words. Firstly, we will grab our IMDb dataset and try out the tokenizer with all the text files.\n\n\nCode\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)\n# path.ls()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfiles = get_text_files(path,folders=['train','test','unsup'])\n\n\nThe default English word tokenizer that FastAI used is called SpaCy which uses a sophisticated riles engine for particular words and URLs. Rather than directly using SpacyTokenizer, we are going to use WordTokenizer which always points to fastai’s current default word tokenizer.\n\n\nCode\ntxt = files[0].open().read()\ntxt[:60]\nspacy = WordTokenizer()\ntoks = first(spacy([txt]))\n\nprint(coll_repr(toks,30))\n\n\n(#365) ['While','the','premise','of','the','film','is','pretty','lame','(','Ollie','is','diagnosed','with','\"','hornophobia','\"',')',',','the','film','is','an','amiable','and','enjoyable','little','flick','.','It'...]\n\n\n\nSub-word tokenization\nIn additions to word tokenizer, sub-word tokenizer is really useful for languages which the spaces are not necessary for separations of components in a sentence (e.g: Chinese). To handle this, we will do 2 steps: - Analyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occurring groups of letters which form the vocab - Tokenize the corpus using this vocab of sub-word units\nFor example, we will first look into 2000 movie reviews:\n\n\nCode\ntxts = L(o.open().read() for o in files[:2000])\ndef subword(sz):\n    sp = SubwordTokenizer(vocab_sz=sz)\n    sp.setup(txts)\n    return ' '.join(first(sp([txt]))[:40])\n\n\nThen, the long underscore is when we replace the space and we can know where the sentences actually start and stop.\n\n\nCode\nsubword(10000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'▁Whil e ▁the ▁premise ▁of ▁the ▁film ▁is ▁pretty ▁lame ▁( O ll ie ▁is ▁diagnos ed ▁with ▁\" hor no pho b ia \") , ▁the ▁film ▁is ▁an ▁a mi able ▁and ▁enjoyable ▁little ▁flick . ▁It \\''\n\n\nIf we use a larger vocab, then most common English words will end up in the vocab themselves, and we will not need as many to represent a sentence. So, there is a compromise to take into account when choosing sub-word vocab: A larger vocab means more fewer tokens per sentence which means faster training, less memory, less state for the model to remember, but it comes to the downside of larger embedding matrix and requiring more data to learn."

It is a little bit different when dealing with texts because it is not desirable to resize the text length. Also, we want the model read texts in order so that it can efficiently predict what the next word is. This suggests that each new batch should begin precisely where the previous one left off.\nSo, the text stream will be cut into a certain number of batches (with batch size) with preserving the order of the tokens. Because we want the model to read continuous rows of the text.\nTo recap, at every epoch, we shuffle our collection of documents and concatenate them into a stream of tokens. Then, that stream will be cut into a batch of fixed size consecutive mini stream. The model will read these mini streams in order and it will produce the same activation.\n\n\nCode\nnums300 = toks300.map(num)\ndl = LMDataLoader(nums300)\nx,y = first(dl)\nx.shape, y.shape\n\n\n(torch.Size([64, 72]), torch.Size([64, 72]))\n\n\nThe batch size is 64x72. 64 is the default batch size and 72 is the default sequence length."

It will take the data from data loader, pretrained model (AWD_LSTM), apply dropout technique and take accuracy as well as perplexity metrics into account. Particularly, accuracy metric is used to evaluate how the correctness when the model tries to predict the next word, while perplexity metric is used to track the (exponential) value of cross-entropy loss.\n\n\nCode\nlearn = language_model_learner(\ndls_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3,\nmetrics=[accuracy, Perplexity()]).to_fp16()\n\n\nThen, we will perform intermediate model training by fitting the model in one training cycle.\n\n\nCode\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(1,2e-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\nperplexity\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n4.022009\n3.903203\n0.300614\n49.560917\n2:10:54\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter few minutes of training, we got the prediction accuracy which is around 29-30 percent. In order to reuse the pre-trained model, we can easily save the model with PyTorch. In this case, we are going to save only learnable parameters (i.e., weight and bias of a model via state_dict) and the updated parameters after one epoch training will be stored at learn.path/'models'/'one_epoch_training_torch.pth'.\n\n\nCode\n# Option 1: Save with FastAI\n# learn.save('one_epoch_training')\n\n# Option 2: Save with PyTorch\nimport torch\nmodel_save_path = learn.path/'models'/'one_epoch_training_torch.pth'\ntorch.save(learn.model.state_dict(), model_save_path)\n# print(f\"Model saved to: {model_save_path}\")\n\n\nOnce the trainable parameters are stored, we can later load those parameter to the compatible model for further training\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation Note: PyTorch Model Loading\n\n\n\nWhen using torch.load(), be cautious about the weights_only parameter. For security reasons, consider using weights_only=True when loading models from untrusted sources to prevent execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Option 1: Use FastAI's load method\n# learn.load('one_epoch_training', strict=False)\n\n# Option 2: Use PyTorch to load the saved model\nimport torch\nmodel_load_path = learn.path/'models'/'one_epoch_training_torch.pth'\nstate_dict = torch.load(model_load_path, weights_only=False)\nlearn.model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)\n# print(f\"Model loaded from: {model_load_path}\")\n\n\n&lt;All keys matched successfully&gt;\n\n\nAfter loading the pre-saved model, we can unfreeze it and train it for few more epochs.

At the end of ten cycle training, the accuracy has increased to around 35 percent. To perform model finetuning, we save the model parameters except the last activation function layer. To do that, we can save it with save_encoder\n\n\nCode\nlearn.save_encoder('finetuned')\n\n\nIn this step, we have fine tuned the language model. Now, we will fine tune this language model using the IMDb sentiment labels.\nAlthough the model is pre-designed for next word prediction, we can also use this model to generate texts. For example, we can self-create a sentence with some words and we parses this sentence to the model to generate a new sentence which has one word longer than the parsed sentence. Leveraging this capability, we are going to create 40 new words from that randomized content.\n\n\nCode\nTEXT = \"I liked this movie so\"\n\nN_WORDS = 40\n\nN_SENTENCES = 2\n\npreds = [learn.predict(TEXT, N_WORDS, temperature=0.75) for _ in range(N_SENTENCES)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see the generation of new inventing words\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"\\n\".join(preds))\n\n\ni liked this movie so much . The characters were believable , the story was believable and entertaining . i will never forget it . Everyone i see this movie has a great time watching it . It is a GREAT\ni liked this movie so much . Although it is not a \" straight to DVD \" movie , it is definitely worth checking out . If you are looking for a good comedy , this is not for you ."
