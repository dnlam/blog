    "text": "Objectives\nIn this notebook, we are going to deep dive into natural language processing (NLP) using Deep Learning (info). Relying on the pretrained language model, we are going to fine-tune it to classify the reviews, and it works as sentiment analysis.\nBased on a language model which has been trained to guess what the next word in the text is, we will apply transfer learning method for this NLP task.\nWe will start with the Wikipedia language model with a subset which we called Wikitext103. Then, we are going to create an ImDb language model which predicts the next word of a movie reviews. This intermediate learning will help us to learn about IMDb-specific kinds of words like the name of actors and directors. Afterwards, we end up with our classifier. \nAs shown in ?@fig-transfer-learning,"

    "text": "General context\nWhen we think about Netflix, we might have watched lots of movies that are science fiction, action, horror etc. Netflix may not know these particular properties of the films you watched, but it would be able to see that other people that watched the same movies could watch other movies that you are not watching yet. By doing recommendation approach, Netflix can recommend us the contents of the movies that we have not watched before but relevant to what we liked.\nThis approach is called collaborative filtering. The key foundation idea is that of latent factors which decides what kinds of movies you want to watch.\n\n\nData set\nIndeed, we can not have access to Netflixâ€™s entire dataset of movie watching history, but there is a great dataset that we can yous, called MovieLen which contains tens millions of movies ranking.\n\n\nCode\nfrom fastai.collab import *\nfrom fastai.tabular.all import *\n\n# path = untar_data(URLs.ML_100k)"
